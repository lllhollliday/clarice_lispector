          Clarice Lispector (born Chaya Pinkhasivna Lispector (Ukrainian: Хая
          Пінкасівна Ліспектор); December 10, 1920 – December 9, 1977) was a
          Ukrainian-born Brazilian novelist and short story writer acclaimed
          internationally for her innovative novels and short stories.
        </p>

        <p>
          Born to a Jewish family in Podolia in Western Ukraine, as an infant
          she moved to Brazil with her family, amidst the disasters engulfing
          her native land following the First World War. She grew up in Recife,
          the capital of the northeastern state of Pernambuco, where her mother
          died when she was nine. The family moved to Rio de Janeiro when she
          was in her teens.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          While in law school in Rio, she began publishing her first
          journalistic work and short stories, catapulting to fame at the age of
          23 with the publication of her first novel, Near to the Wild Heart
          (Perto do Coração Selvagem), written as an interior monologue in a
          style and language that was considered revolutionary in Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>
          She left Brazil in 1944, following her marriage to a Brazilian
          diplomat, and spent the next decade and a half in Europe and the
          United States. After returning to Rio de Janeiro in 1959, she began
          producing her most famous works, including the stories of Family Ties
          (Laços de Família), the great mystic novel The Passion According to
          G.H. (A Paixão Segundo G.H.), and what is arguably her masterpiece,
          Água Viva. Injured in an accident in 1966, she spent the last decade
          of her life in frequent pain, steadily writing and publishing novels
          and stories until her premature death in 1977.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has been the subject of numerous books, and references to her and
          her work are common in Brazilian literature and music. Several of her
          works have been turned into films. In 2009, the American writer
          Benjamin Moser published Why This World: A Biography of Clarice
          Lispector. Since that publication, her works have been the object of
          an extensive project of retranslation, published by New Directions
          Publishing and Penguin Modern Classics, the first Brazilian to enter
          that prestigious series. Moser, who is also the editor of her
          anthology The Complete Stories (2015), describes Lispector as the most
          important Jewish writer in the world since Kafka.
